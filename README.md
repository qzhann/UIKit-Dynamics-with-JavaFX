# UIKit-Dynamics-with-JavaFX
Inspired by UIKit Dynamics, this JavaFX project includes a declarative Java animation framework I wrote. The framework abstracted collision, push, and item behaviors into seperate reusable components, allowing developers to use each component without having to wrestle directly with the JavaFX animation APIs.
