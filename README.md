# UIKit-Dynamics-with-JavaFX
This JavaFX project includes a declarative Java animation framework I wrote, inspired by UIKit Dynamics. The framework abstracted collision, push, and item behaviors into seperate reusable components, allowing developers to use each component without having to wrestle directly with the JavaFX animation APIs.
